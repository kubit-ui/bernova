## Contributing

We welcome contributions to **bernova**! This project is open source and we encourage community participation through **forks and pull requests**. All contributions must be made through the fork workflow - we do not accept direct pushes to the main repository.

### Why Fork-Based Contributing?

This project follows the **fork-based contribution model** to:

- Maintain code quality and security
- Ensure all changes are reviewed before merging
- Keep the main repository clean and stable
- Allow contributors to work independently on features

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the [bernova repository](https://github.com/kubit-ui/bernova) on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine (not the original repository).

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bernova.git
   cd bernova
   ```

3. **Add Original Repository as Upstream**: Add the original repository as a remote to keep your fork synchronized.

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubit-ui/bernova.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```

4. **Create a Feature Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes. Use proper branch naming conventions for automatic version detection.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <branch-type>/<branch-name>
   ```

5. **Make Changes**:
   - Make your changes to the bernova codebase
   - Follow the coding standards outlined in our style guide
   - Add or update tests for your changes
   - Update documentation if necessary
   - Test your changes thoroughly using `npm test`

6. **Commit Changes**: Use conventional commit messages for automatic versioning.

   ```sh
   git commit -m "feat(css): add new responsive grid system"
   ```

7. **Keep Your Fork Updated**: Before pushing, sync with the upstream repository.

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

8. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository (never to the original).

   ```sh
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original [bernova repository](https://github.com/kubit-ui/bernova)
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Select "compare across forks"
   - Choose your fork and branch as the source
   - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes
   - Submit the pull request for review

### Branch Naming & Automatic Publishing with Changesets

This repository uses **[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)** for automated version management and publishing. When your PR is merged, the package will be automatically versioned, changelog updated, and published to NPM.

#### How It Works

1. **You create a PR** with proper branch naming and conventional commit messages
2. **Automated validation** checks your branch name, PR title, and code quality
3. **On merge**, a changeset is auto-generated based on your branch type
4. **Version is bumped** automatically (major/minor/patch)
5. **CHANGELOG is updated** with your changes
6. **Package is built and published** to NPM
7. **GitHub Release is created** with release notes
8. **PR comment** confirms the published version

#### Branch Naming Patterns (Required)

Use these branch prefixes - they determine the version bump type:

| Branch Pattern          | Version Bump | Example                      | When to Use                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `feat/` or `feature/`   | **MINOR**    | `feat/grid-system`           | New features, CSS utilities, or APIs  |
| `fix/` or `bugfix/`     | **PATCH**    | `fix/button-styling`         | Bug fixes in styles or functionality  |
| `break/` or `breaking/` | **MAJOR**    | `break/remove-old-vars-api`  | Breaking changes to public API        |
| `hotfix/`               | **PATCH**    | `hotfix/critical-layout-bug` | Urgent production fixes               |
| `chore/`                | **PATCH**    | `chore/update-deps`          | Maintenance, deps, or refactoring     |
| `docs/`                 | **PATCH**    | `docs/update-readme`         | Documentation only changes            |
| `style/`                | **PATCH**    | `style/format-code`          | Code style/formatting changes         |
| `refactor/`             | **PATCH**    | `refactor/simplify-logic`    | Code refactoring without new features |
| `test/`                 | **PATCH**    | `test/add-unit-tests`        | Adding or updating tests              |

#### PR Title Format (Required)

Your PR title **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <description>
```

**Examples:**

- ✅ `feat: add responsive grid system`
- ✅ `fix: resolve button hover state issue`
- ✅ `docs: update installation guide`
- ✅ `refactor: simplify CSS generation logic`
- ❌ `Added new feature` (missing type)
- ❌ `fix button` (missing colon)

**With scope (optional but recommended):**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Examples:**

- ✅ `feat(css): add spacing utility classes`
- ✅ `fix(build): resolve minification error`
- ✅ `docs(readme): add usage examples`

**Breaking changes:**

```
<type>!: <description>
```

or

```
<type>(<scope>)!: <description>
```

**Examples:**

- ✅ `feat!: redesign CSS variable naming convention`
- ✅ `refactor(api)!: change provider interface`

#### Commit Message Guidelines

While your commits don't directly affect versioning (the branch name does), **good commit messages are essential** for:

- Code review clarity
- Git history readability
- Future maintenance
- Team collaboration

**Follow Conventional Commits:**

```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat(css): add margin utility classes"
git commit -m "feat(provider): add theme switching support"

# Bug fix commits
git commit -m "fix(build): resolve TypeScript compilation error"
git commit -m "fix(styles): correct button padding in mobile view"

# Documentation commits
git commit -m "docs(readme): add installation instructions"
git commit -m "docs(api): document CSS variable usage"

# Refactoring commits
git commit -m "refactor(core): simplify style generation logic"
git commit -m "refactor(utils): extract common helper functions"

# Test commits
git commit -m "test(unit): add tests for CSS parser"
git commit -m "test(integration): add build process tests"

# Chore commits
git commit -m "chore(deps): update postcss to v8.5.0"
git commit -m "chore(ci): improve GitHub Actions workflow"
```

**Commit message structure:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Example with body:**

```
feat(css): add responsive grid system

Implements a 12-column grid system with breakpoints for
mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. Includes utility
classes for column spans and offsets.

Closes #123
```

#### Version Detection Logic

The automated system determines version bumps in this order:

1. **Branch name** (primary detection)
   - `feat/` or `feature/` → MINOR
   - `break/` or `breaking/` → MAJOR
   - Everything else → PATCH

2. **PR title** (secondary detection)
   - `feat:` → MINOR
   - `break:` or `breaking:` → MAJOR
   - `!` suffix → MAJOR (e.g., `feat!:`)
   - Everything else → PATCH

#### Complete Workflow Examples

**Example 1: Adding a new CSS utility (MINOR version)**

```sh
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/spacing-utilities

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat(css): add margin and padding utility classes"
git commit -m "docs(css): document new spacing utilities"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin feat/spacing-utilities

# 5. Create PR with title: "feat(css): add spacing utility classes"
# Result after merge: MINOR bump (1.3.2 → 1.4.0)
```

**Example 2: Fixing a bug (PATCH version)**

```sh
# 1. Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix/button-hover-state

# 2. Fix the issue
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Commit the fix
git commit -m "fix(button): resolve hover state color inconsistency"
git commit -m "test(button): add test for hover state"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin fix/button-hover-state

# 5. Create PR with title: "fix(button): resolve hover state styling issue"
# Result after merge: PATCH bump (1.3.2 → 1.3.3)
```

**Example 3: Breaking changes (MAJOR version)**

```sh
# 1. Create breaking change branch
git checkout -b break/css-vars-restructure

# 2. Make breaking changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Commit with breaking change indicator
git commit -m "feat!: restructure CSS custom properties"
git commit -m "docs: add migration guide for v2.0.0"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin break/css-vars-restructure

# 5. Create PR with title: "feat!: restructure CSS custom properties"
# PR description should include:
# "BREAKING CHANGE: CSS variables have been renamed for better consistency.
# See migration guide for details."
# Result after merge: MAJOR bump (1.3.2 → 2.0.0)
```
